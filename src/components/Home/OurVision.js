        Above all, your mission statement is a marketing asset that is meant to
        be clear, concise, and free of fluff. It should clearly outline the
        purpose of your company offering and demonstrate the common goals the
        company is working to achieve. You should also have other team members
        or advisors read the mission statement and make adjustments if needed
        according to their recommendation. Both mission and vision statements
        are often combined into one comprehensive "mission statement" to define
        the organization's reason for existing and its outlook for internal and
        external audiences â€” like employees, partners, board members, consumers,
        and shareholders. The difference between mission and vision statements
        lies in the purpose they serve.
